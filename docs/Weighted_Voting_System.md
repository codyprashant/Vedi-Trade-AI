# Weighted Voting Decision Aggregation System

## Overview

The Weighted Voting Decision Aggregation System is an advanced signal processing mechanism that combines multiple technical indicators using a sophisticated voting algorithm. This system replaces simple majority-based decisions with a nuanced approach that considers indicator strength, reliability, and market context.

## Key Features

### 🗳️ **Weighted Voting Algorithm**
- Each indicator contributes a vote (-1 for sell, 0 for neutral, +1 for buy)
- Votes are weighted by indicator importance and signal strength
- Strong signals receive full weight, weak signals receive reduced weight (60%)

### 📊 **Signal Strength Classification**
- **Strong Signals**: High-confidence directional signals (e.g., RSI oversold/overbought)
- **Weak Signals**: Lower-confidence directional signals (e.g., mild trend indicators)
- **Neutral Signals**: No clear directional bias

### 🎯 **Confidence Scoring**
- Dynamic confidence calculation based on vote consensus
- Boosted confidence for multiple strong signals
- Capped at 1.0 (100%) for maximum reliability

## Technical Implementation

### Core Function: `compute_weighted_vote_aggregation`

```python
def compute_weighted_vote_aggregation(results: Dict[str, IndicatorResult], weights: Dict[str, float] | None = None) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """
    Aggregate indicator votes using a weighted voting system.
    
    Args:
        results: Dictionary of indicator results with vote/strength/label fields
        weights: Optional weights for each indicator (defaults to equal weights)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing aggregated vote results with detailed breakdown
    """
```

### Input Structure

Each indicator result contains:
- `vote`: Integer (-1, 0, 1) representing sell/neutral/buy
- `strength`: Float (0.0-1.0) representing signal strength
- `label`: String ('weak' or 'strong') classifying signal confidence
- `direction`: String direction for backward compatibility

### Output Structure

```python
{
    "total_vote_score": float,      # Normalized weighted vote score
    "final_direction": str,         # "buy", "sell", or "neutral"
    "confidence": float,            # Confidence level (0.0-1.0)
    "vote_breakdown": dict,         # Detailed per-indicator breakdown
    "indicator_count": int,         # Number of valid indicators
    "strong_signals": int,          # Count of strong signals
    "weak_signals": int            # Count of weak signals
}
```

## Integration with Threshold Manager

### Enhanced Dynamic Thresholds

The weighted voting system integrates with the `ThresholdManager` through the new `compute_dynamic_threshold_with_votes` method:

```python
def compute_dynamic_threshold_with_votes(
    self,
    base_strength: float,
    final_strength: float,
    confidence_zone: str,
    vote_result: Dict[str, any],
    market_conditions: Dict[str, float]
) -> Dict[str, any]:
```

### Vote Integration Factors

The threshold calculation now considers:
- **Vote Consensus**: How aligned the indicators are
- **Signal Strength Distribution**: Balance of strong vs weak signals
- **Confidence Amplification**: Boost thresholds for high-confidence signals

### Threshold Metadata

Enhanced threshold results include:
```python
{
    "threshold": float,
    "threshold_factors": {
        "base_threshold": float,
        "confidence_multiplier": float,
        "market_condition_factor": float,
        "vote_integration": {
            "consensus_factor": float,
            "strength_distribution": float,
            "confidence_amplification": float
        }
    },
    "threshold_metadata": {
        "calculation_method": "dynamic_with_votes",
        "vote_consensus": float,
        "strong_signal_count": int,
        "total_indicators": int
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from app.indicators import compute_weighted_vote_aggregation

# Indicator results from evaluate_signals()
indicators = {
    "RSI": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=0.85, label="strong", ...),
    "MACD": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=0.70, label="strong", ...),
    "BBANDS": IndicatorResult(direction="neutral", vote=0, strength=0.50, label="weak", ...)
}

# Default weights
weights = {"RSI": 15, "MACD": 20, "BBANDS": 15}

# Compute weighted vote
result = compute_weighted_vote_aggregation(indicators, weights)

print(f"Direction: {result['final_direction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
print(f"Strong Signals: {result['strong_signals']}")
```

### Integration with Signal Engine

```python
# In signal_engine.py
vote_result = compute_weighted_vote_aggregation(res, weights)

# Use with enhanced threshold calculation
threshold_result = threshold_manager.compute_dynamic_threshold_with_votes(
    base_strength=base_strength,
    final_strength=final_strength,
    confidence_zone=confidence_zone,
    vote_result=vote_result,
    market_conditions={
        "atr_ratio": atr_ratio,
        "rsi_deviation": rsi_deviation,
        "macd_deviation": macd_deviation
    }
)
```

## Algorithm Details

### Vote Score Calculation

1. **Weighted Contribution**: `vote × strength × weight × strength_multiplier`
2. **Strength Multiplier**: 1.0 for strong signals, 0.6 for weak signals
3. **Normalization**: Total weighted vote ÷ total weight

### Direction Determination

- **Buy**: `vote_score > 0.1`
- **Sell**: `vote_score < -0.1`
- **Neutral**: `-0.1 ≤ vote_score ≤ 0.1`

### Confidence Calculation

1. **Base Confidence**: `min(abs(vote_score), 1.0)`
2. **Strong Signal Bonus**: 
   - 20% boost for 2+ strong signals
   - 10% boost for 1 strong + 2+ weak signals
3. **Final Cap**: Maximum confidence of 1.0

## Benefits
