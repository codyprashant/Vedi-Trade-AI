# Weighted Voting Decision Aggregation System

## Overview

The Weighted Voting Decision Aggregation System is an advanced signal processing mechanism that combines multiple technical indicators using a sophisticated voting algorithm. This system replaces simple majority-based decisions with a nuanced approach that considers indicator strength, reliability, and market context.

## Key Features

### 🗳️ **Weighted Voting Algorithm**
- Each indicator contributes a vote (-1 for sell, 0 for neutral, +1 for buy)
- Votes are weighted by indicator importance and signal strength
- Strong signals receive full weight, weak signals receive reduced weight (60%)

### 📊 **Signal Strength Classification**
- **Strong Signals**: High-confidence directional signals (e.g., RSI oversold/overbought)
- **Weak Signals**: Lower-confidence directional signals (e.g., mild trend indicators)
- **Neutral Signals**: No clear directional bias

### 🎯 **Confidence Scoring**
- Dynamic confidence calculation based on vote consensus
- Boosted confidence for multiple strong signals
- Capped at 1.0 (100%) for maximum reliability

## Technical Implementation

### Core Function: `compute_weighted_vote_aggregation`

```python
def compute_weighted_vote_aggregation(results: Dict[str, IndicatorResult], weights: Dict[str, float] | None = None) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """
    Aggregate indicator votes using a weighted voting system.
    
    Args:
        results: Dictionary of indicator results with vote/strength/label fields
        weights: Optional weights for each indicator (defaults to equal weights)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing aggregated vote results with detailed breakdown
    """
```

### Input Structure

Each indicator result contains:
- `vote`: Integer (-1, 0, 1) representing sell/neutral/buy
- `strength`: Float (0.0-1.0) representing signal strength
- `label`: String ('weak' or 'strong') classifying signal confidence
- `direction`: String direction for backward compatibility

### Output Structure

```python
{
    "total_vote_score": float,      # Normalized weighted vote score
    "final_direction": str,         # "buy", "sell", or "neutral"
    "confidence": float,            # Confidence level (0.0-1.0)
    "vote_breakdown": dict,         # Detailed per-indicator breakdown
    "indicator_count": int,         # Number of valid indicators
    "strong_signals": int,          # Count of strong signals
    "weak_signals": int            # Count of weak signals
}
```

## Integration with Threshold Manager

### Enhanced Dynamic Thresholds

The weighted voting system integrates with the `ThresholdManager` through the new `compute_dynamic_threshold_with_votes` method:

```python
def compute_dynamic_threshold_with_votes(
    self,
    base_strength: float,
    final_strength: float,
    confidence_zone: str,
    vote_result: Dict[str, any],
    market_conditions: Dict[str, float]
) -> Dict[str, any]:
```

### Vote Integration Factors

The threshold calculation now considers:
- **Vote Consensus**: How aligned the indicators are
- **Signal Strength Distribution**: Balance of strong vs weak signals
- **Confidence Amplification**: Boost thresholds for high-confidence signals

### Threshold Metadata

Enhanced threshold results include:
```python
{
    "threshold": float,
    "threshold_factors": {
        "base_threshold": float,
        "confidence_multiplier": float,
        "market_condition_factor": float,
        "vote_integration": {
            "consensus_factor": float,
            "strength_distribution": float,
            "confidence_amplification": float
        }
    },
    "threshold_metadata": {
        "calculation_method": "dynamic_with_votes",
        "vote_consensus": float,
        "strong_signal_count": int,
        "total_indicators": int
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from app.indicators import compute_weighted_vote_aggregation

# Indicator results from evaluate_signals()
indicators = {
    "RSI": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=0.85, label="strong", ...),
    "MACD": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=0.70, label="strong", ...),
    "BBANDS": IndicatorResult(direction="neutral", vote=0, strength=0.50, label="weak", ...)
}

# Default weights
weights = {"RSI": 15, "MACD": 20, "BBANDS": 15}

# Compute weighted vote
result = compute_weighted_vote_aggregation(indicators, weights)

print(f"Direction: {result['final_direction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
print(f"Strong Signals: {result['strong_signals']}")
```

### Integration with Signal Engine

```python
# In signal_engine.py
vote_result = compute_weighted_vote_aggregation(res, weights)

# Use with enhanced threshold calculation
threshold_result = threshold_manager.compute_dynamic_threshold_with_votes(
    base_strength=base_strength,
    final_strength=final_strength,
    confidence_zone=confidence_zone,
    vote_result=vote_result,
    market_conditions={
        "atr_ratio": atr_ratio,
        "rsi_deviation": rsi_deviation,
        "macd_deviation": macd_deviation
    }
)
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Strong Bullish Consensus

#### Input Indicators
```python
indicators = {
    "RSI": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=85.0, label="strong"),
    "MACD": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=90.0, label="strong"),
    "BBANDS": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=75.0, label="strong"),
    "SMA_EMA": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=80.0, label="strong"),
    "STOCH": IndicatorResult(direction="neutral", vote=0, strength=50.0, label="weak")
}

weights = {"RSI": 15, "MACD": 20, "BBANDS": 10, "SMA_EMA": 15, "STOCH": 10}
```

#### Calculation Process
```
1. Effective Votes:
   - RSI: 1 × 1.0 = 1.0 (strong)
   - MACD: 1 × 1.0 = 1.0 (strong)
   - BBANDS: 1 × 1.0 = 1.0 (strong)
   - SMA_EMA: 1 × 1.0 = 1.0 (strong)
   - STOCH: 0 × 1.0 = 0.0 (neutral)

2. Weighted Score:
   weighted_score = (15×1.0) + (20×1.0) + (10×1.0) + (15×1.0) + (10×0.0) = 60.0
   max_possible_score = 15 + 20 + 10 + 15 + 10 = 70.0

3. Normalized Score:
   normalized_score = (60.0 / 70.0) × 100 = 85.7

4. Direction: 85.7 ≥ 60.0 → "buy"

5. Confidence:
   base_confidence = min(85.7 / 100.0, 1.0) = 0.857
   strong_signals = 4 ≥ 2 → confidence_multiplier = 1.2
   final_confidence = min(0.857 × 1.2, 1.0) = 1.0
```

#### Output
```python
{
    "weighted_score": 60.0,
    "normalized_score": 85.7,
    "final_direction": "buy",
    "signal_strength": 85.7,
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "strong_signals": 4,
    "weak_signals": 0,
    "indicator_count": 5,
    "threshold_used": 60.0
}
```

### Example 2: Mixed Signals with Weak Consensus

#### Input Indicators
```python
indicators = {
    "RSI": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=60.0, label="weak"),
    "MACD": IndicatorResult(direction="sell", vote=-1, strength=55.0, label="weak"),
    "BBANDS": IndicatorResult(direction="neutral", vote=0, strength=50.0, label="weak"),
    "SMA_EMA": IndicatorResult(direction="buy", vote=1, strength=70.0, label="strong"),
    "STOCH": IndicatorResult(direction="sell", vote=-1, strength=65.0, label="weak")
}
```

#### Calculation Process
```
1. Effective Votes:
   - RSI: 1 × 0.5 = 0.5 (weak)
   - MACD: -1 × 0.5 = -0.5 (weak)
   - BBANDS: 0 × 0.5 = 0.0 (neutral)
   - SMA_EMA: 1 × 1.0 = 1.0 (strong)
   - STOCH: -1 × 0.5 = -0.5 (weak)

2. Weighted Score:
   weighted_score = (15×0.5) + (20×-0.5) + (10×0.0) + (15×1.0) + (10×-0.5) = 7.5 - 10.0 + 0.0 + 15.0 - 5.0 = 7.5

3. Normalized Score:
   normalized_score = (7.5 / 70.0) × 100 = 10.7

4. Direction: -60.0 < 10.7 < 60.0 → "neutral"

5. Confidence:
   base_confidence = min(10.7 / 100.0, 1.0) = 0.107
   strong_signals = 1, weak_signals = 3 ≥ 2 → confidence_multiplier = 1.1
   final_confidence = min(0.107 × 1.1, 1.0) = 0.118
```

#### Output
```python
{
    "weighted_score": 7.5,
    "normalized_score": 10.7,
    "final_direction": "neutral",
    "signal_strength": 0.0,
    "confidence": 0.118,
    "strong_signals": 1,
    "weak_signals": 3,
    "indicator_count": 5,
    "threshold_used": 60.0
}
```

### Example 3: Strong Bearish Consensus

#### Input Indicators
```python
indicators = {
    "RSI": IndicatorResult(direction="sell", vote=-1, strength=85.0, label="strong"),
    "MACD": IndicatorResult(direction="sell", vote=-1, strength=90.0, label="strong"),
    "BBANDS": IndicatorResult(direction="sell", vote=-1, strength=75.0, label="strong"),
    "SMA_EMA": IndicatorResult(direction="sell", vote=-1, strength=80.0, label="strong")
}
```

#### Calculation Process
```
1. Effective Votes: All -1.0 (strong sell signals)
2. Weighted Score: -(15 + 20 + 10 + 15) = -60.0
3. Normalized Score: (-60.0 / 60.0) × 100 = -100.0
4. Direction: -100.0 ≤ -60.0 → "sell"
5. Confidence: min(1.0 × 1.2, 1.0) = 1.0 (4 strong signals)
```

#### Output
```python
{
    "weighted_score": -60.0,
    "normalized_score": -100.0,
    "final_direction": "sell",
    "signal_strength": 100.0,
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "strong_signals": 4,
    "weak_signals": 0,
    "indicator_count": 4,
    "threshold_used": 60.0
}
```

## Algorithm Details

### Mathematical Formulas

#### 1. Effective Vote Calculation
For each indicator `i`:
```
effective_vote_i = {
    vote_i           if label_i == 'strong'    (full weight)
    vote_i × 0.5     if label_i == 'weak'      (partial weight)
    0.0              if label_i == 'neutral'   (no contribution)
}
```

#### 2. Weighted Score Calculation
```
weighted_score = Σ(weight_i × effective_vote_i) for all indicators i
max_possible_score = Σ|weight_i| for all indicators i
```

#### 3. Normalized Score Calculation
```
normalized_score = (weighted_score / max_possible_score) × 100
```
Range: [-100, +100] where:
- +100 = All indicators strongly bullish
- -100 = All indicators strongly bearish
- 0 = Perfect neutrality

#### 4. Direction Determination
```
final_direction = {
    "buy"      if normalized_score ≥ +threshold
    "sell"     if normalized_score ≤ -threshold  
    "neutral"  otherwise
}
```
Default threshold = 60.0 (configurable)

#### 5. Confidence Calculation
```
base_confidence = min(|normalized_score| / 100.0, 1.0)

confidence_multiplier = {
    1.2  if strong_signals ≥ 2
    1.1  if strong_signals == 1 AND weak_signals ≥ 2
    1.0  otherwise
}

final_confidence = min(base_confidence × confidence_multiplier, 1.0)
```

### Signal Strength Classification

- **Strong Signals**: Full vote weight (1.0 multiplier)
  - RSI oversold/overbought (< 30 or > 70)
  - MACD strong crossovers
  - Clear trend confirmations
- **Weak Signals**: Partial vote weight (0.5 multiplier)
  - Mild trend indicators
  - Borderline oscillator readings
  - Uncertain market conditions
- **Neutral Signals**: No contribution (0.0 multiplier)
  - Indicators in equilibrium
  - Conflicting or unclear signals

## Benefits

### 🎯 **Improved Accuracy**
- Reduces false signals from conflicting indicators
- Weights reliable indicators more heavily
- Considers signal strength, not just direction

    "STOCH": 5
}
```

### Dynamic Weight Adjustment

#### Market Regime Detection
```python
def adjust_weights_for_market_regime(base_weights, market_conditions):
    """
    Dynamically adjust weights based on market conditions.
    
    Args:
        base_weights: Default weight configuration
        market_conditions: Dict with volatility, trend_strength, etc.
    
    Returns:
        Adjusted weights dictionary
    """
    adjusted = base_weights.copy()
    
    # High volatility adjustment
    if market_conditions.get('atr_ratio', 0) > 0.02:
        adjusted['ATR_STABILITY'] *= 1.5
        adjusted['BBANDS'] *= 1.3
        adjusted['MACD'] *= 0.8
    
    # Strong trend adjustment
    if market_conditions.get('trend_strength', 0) > 0.7:
        adjusted['MACD'] *= 1.4
        adjusted['SMA_EMA'] *= 1.3
        adjusted['RSI'] *= 0.7
    
    # Range-bound adjustment
    if market_conditions.get('trend_strength', 0) < 0.3:
        adjusted['RSI'] *= 1.4
        adjusted['BBANDS'] *= 1.3
        adjusted['MACD'] *= 0.6
    
    return adjusted
```

### Threshold Configuration

#### Dynamic Threshold Examples
```python
# Conservative (higher threshold = fewer signals)
CONSERVATIVE_THRESHOLD = 75.0

# Balanced (default)
BALANCED_THRESHOLD = 60.0

# Aggressive (lower threshold = more signals)
AGGRESSIVE_THRESHOLD = 45.0

# Market-specific thresholds
FOREX_THRESHOLD = 55.0      # Currency pairs
CRYPTO_THRESHOLD = 65.0     # Cryptocurrency
STOCKS_THRESHOLD = 60.0     # Equity markets
COMMODITIES_THRESHOLD = 70.0 # Commodity futures
```

### Customization Guidelines

#### Weight Adjustment Principles
1. **Total Weight Balance**: Maintain reasonable total weight (100-120 range)
2. **Indicator Correlation**: Reduce weights for highly correlated indicators
3. **Market Adaptation**: Adjust based on current market regime
4. **Performance Feedback**: Use backtesting to optimize weights
5. **Risk Management**: Higher weights for reliable, lower-risk indicators

#### Performance Monitoring
```python
def evaluate_weight_performance(historical_signals, actual_outcomes):
    """
    Evaluate the performance of current weight configuration.
    
    Returns:
        Dict with accuracy, precision, recall metrics per indicator
    """
    performance_metrics = {}
    
    for indicator in WEIGHTS.keys():
        # Calculate indicator-specific performance
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(indicator, historical_signals, actual_outcomes)
        precision = calculate_precision(indicator, historical_signals, actual_outcomes)
        recall = calculate_recall(indicator, historical_signals, actual_outcomes)
        
        performance_metrics[indicator] = {
            'accuracy': accuracy,
            'precision': precision,
            'recall': recall,
            'suggested_weight': optimize_weight(accuracy, precision, recall)
        }
    
    return performance_metrics
```
